## The Watchlist

The Watchlist is a Web App where users can add new and upcoming movies to their list, so they never forget to watch it. The Watchlist is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for the user interface, and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for it's responsiveness. [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for user authentication, and for its real-time database to store movies. All the movie data is fetched from the [Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) using [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

## Getting Started

In the project directory:
1. npm / yarn install
2. npm / yarn start
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Future of The Watchlist
1. Search functionality for all movies, not just upcoming / new.
2. Filter genres functionality.
3. Some sort of push notification / email notification reminding users that a movie is out / soon to be out

## Enjoy!
